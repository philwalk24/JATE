# JATE


## Description
This app lets you have an app called Just Another Text Editor. This project uses a client/server set-up. You can install the JATE and can write javascript code with it, and even save those files to your computer. Your data is saved to the page even when you close the program down.

## Installation
Simply clone the github repo and run npm i in the root. Then, you just run npm start and go to localhost:3000.

## Usage
Simply type anywhere on the page and have fun!

## Testing
To test this project, I used the .gifs in the submission page to see when I got it working. Also checking the Application page in Inspect Element helped to see if the data was being saved.

## Credits
The module 19 Challenge folder helped me a lot when I got stuck. I tried to leave lots of comments to show what was happening in all the important bits. Absolutely no thanks for the Heroku troubleshooting website (see note attatched).
